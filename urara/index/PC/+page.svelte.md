# Budget PC setup

### The begining ☀️

So this all started when I was like 10 . And man, those times. With my friends we were used to play on just everything. I had an old Asus ROG laptop, you may see ROG that shouldn't be that bad. Minecraft 1.13 just dropped, and with it so did my FPS. I went from 30 to 15 📉. Running Windows 7 and huge 4GB of RAM ⚖️.
<br />
At that time I've also got into coding and scripting 👨‍💻. And I was in need of a new computer. Got the new computer and it lasted with me for around 3 years. And again I was in need of something **BIG** something **that would meet all my needs!** Yea, I started saving and after a long wait of 6 months or 15759360 seconds ⏱️ of counting and *ahhh* There it is 😎! 

### The Build 🧭
* **CPU**: 12900k 16 cores - clocked to 5,3 Ghz
* **GPU**: Asus ROG Strix 4070ti OC
* **RAM**: Corsair Vengeance 32GB DDR4 RGB RT white - clocked to 4000 MT/s
* **Motherboard**: Asus Z690 TUF Gaming Plus
* **PSU**: Cooler Master V850 GOLD V2 White
* **AIO**: Corsair Capelix elite h115i
* **Case**: Lian-li Air Mini

### Things weren't that smooth tho 😂
The case in the configuration is well not ideal. My first case for this build originally was H510 from NZXT. But due to my GPU fitting by space in size of sheet of paper and not able to close the side panel because of the cable I had to get a new one <br />

So yeah... Next I got brand new and shiny Air Mini and yet again another complication. But I calculated that one, I wasnt the only one with this problem. And I did know it before buying the new case. The AIO wouldn't fit. <br />
