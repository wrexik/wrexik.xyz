### The beginning ☀️

So this all started when I was like 10. And man, those times. With my friends we were used to play on just everything. I had an old Asus ROG laptop, you may see ROG that shouldn't be that bad. Minecraft 1.13 just dropped, and with it so did my FPS. I went from 30 to 15 📉. Running Windows 7 and a huge 4GB of RAM ⚖️. <br />
At that time I also got into coding and scripting 👨‍💻. And I was in need of a new computer. Got the new computer and it lasted with me for around 3 years. And again I was in need of something **BIG** that would meet all my needs! Yea, I started saving and after a long wait of 6 months or 15759360 seconds ⏱️ of counting and *ahhh* There it is 😎! 

### The Build 🧭
* **CPU**: i9 12900k 16 cores - clocked to 5,3 Ghz
* **GPU**: Asus ROG Strix 4070ti OC
* **RAM**: Corsair Vengeance 32GB DDR4 RGB RT white - clocked to 4000 MT/s
* **Motherboard**: Asus Z690 TUF Gaming Plus
* **PSU**: Cooler Master V850 GOLD V2 White
* **AIO**: Corsair Capelix elite h115i
* **Case**: Lian-li Air Mini

### Things weren't that smooth tho 😂:
The case in the configuration is well not ideal. Originally, my first case for this build was the H510 from NZXT. But due to my GPU being the size of a **sheet of paper** and not able to close the side panel because of the cable, I had to get a new one <br />

So yeah... Next, I got a brand new and shiny **Air Mini** and yet again another complication. But I calculated that one, I wasn't the only one with this problem. And I did know this before buying the new case. The AIO wouldn't fit. <br />

And this was pretty easy, but impossible without [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnhjMb_ozb0) video, love you dude :D.

### And this is it!
