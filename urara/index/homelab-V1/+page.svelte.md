### Current Hardware üßë‚Äçüíª
* (1) Raspberry Pi 3B+ - 1Gbps link ‚óè Running Docker
  * Portainer - Docker management UI
  * Tailscale - VPN to connect to it remotely
  * Nginx - Web server
  * Uptime Kuma - WebUI monitoring panel
  <br />

* (2) Raspberry Pi 3B+ - 1Gbps link ‚óè Running Docker
    * Portainer - Docker management UI
    * Tailscale - VPN to connect to it remotely
```(2) Used for testing and development right now, will be used for remote desktop access to my homelab in the future.```

* Old HP z400 Xeon desktop - 100Mbps link, local only ‚óè Running CasaOS
    * Crafty - Minecraft server manager
    * Portainer - Docker management UI
    * Nexcloud - Cloud storage (8tb)

<br />

#### Networking Hardware
* (1) Ubiquiti EdgeSwitch ES-8-150W - 8 port gigabit managed switch with PoE support.
