# Hey, I'm Wrexik
You can usually catch me around 7 AM ☀️ - 1 AM 🌙. Yeah, there is so much to see each day. My favorite activities are exploring the internet, coding, gaming, and streaming. IT is not my only interest; I also like to *read*—maybe not that, but I love riding bikes 🚲. Also, check out my [new site](https://catgirl.singles), being hosted only on a Pi 3B+ 🐌! Whether it's downhill or urban, it's mine 💖.
