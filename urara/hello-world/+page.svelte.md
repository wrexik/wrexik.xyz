# Hey, I'm Wrexik
You can usually catch me around 7AM ☀️ - 1AM 🌙. Yeah, there is so much to see each day. 
 My favorite activities are exploring internet, coding, gaming and streaming. 
 IT is not my only interest, I also like to ```*read*``` maybe not that but I love riding bikes 🚲. 
Whether it's downhill or urban, it's mine 💖.
